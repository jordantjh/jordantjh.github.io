          <h2>Who am I</h2>
          <p>
          In the words of someone who knows me very well. <a href="https://goo.gl/BGHNxG" target="_blank">Read it here.</a>
          </p>

          <br><br>

          <h2>What I think make me stand out</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><h5>I have the courage and the heart to voice constructive opinions.</h5></li>
            <p>
              <b>Example 1:</b> I went up to the manager of the Panda Express restaurant on our university campus,
              asking for her email so that I could send her the many problems I observed in her restaurant along with my suggestions on how to improve things. Eventually, we became friend and she even offered me to attend their company manager training program so that I could become one.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Example 2:</b> During summer 2016, I notice that all the printers in ECE building were not able to print two-sidedly. I then emailed the Head of ECE department suggesting to invest in printers that allow two-sided printing explaining how this change could help saving some departmental expenditure in the long run while also preserving the environment. A small act that has made a difference to the world since then.
            </p>
            <li><h5>I learn new things all the time and I learn fast.</h5></li>
            <p><b>Example 1:</b> I've finished a web development course on Udemy, that is 46-hour long in video content, over a weekend. And right on the next Monday, I started applying the new skills to build <a href="mixtaped.html" target="_blank">Mixtaped</a> website.</p>
            <li><h5>I can think independently.</h5></li>
            <p>
              <b>Example 1:</b> I disagree with our education system in many ways. I think schooling is an impedance to learning. Is schooling the best way to learn? How many percentage of all the things we learn in school do we actually use in our lives?
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Example 2:</b> I disagree with the concept of marriage and family. Hence, I have a vision to create a new form of society where people would live very differently than how they live today. And this will give rise to a new era of happy, authentic, and energetic world of lively people.</p>
            </p>
          </ul>

          <p>
            All in all, I'm certain there is a lot I can provide to my future employer with what shown above and every good things that my recommenders wrote about.
