        <!--<h2>Who am I</h2>
          <p>
          In the words of someone who knows me very well. <a href="https://goo.gl/BGHNxG" target="_blank">Letter from Ted.</a>
          </p>

          <br><br>  -->

        <h1>Me By Examples</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h5>I voice constructive opinions.</h5>
          </li>
          <p>
            <b>Example 1:</b> &nbsp;I approached a Panda Express's manager one day,
            asking for her email so that I could send her the many problems I observed in her restaurant along with my
            suggestions on how to improve things. Eventually, we became friend and she even offered me a job so that I
            could become a manager for the company myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Example 2:</b> &nbsp;During summer 2016, I notice that all the printers in ECE building were not able to
            print double-sidedly. I then emailed the IT department to suggest investing in printers that are capable of
            double-sided printing. I eventually had to talk to the Head of ECE department. I explained how this change
            could help saving some departmental expenditure in the long run while also preserving the environment. And
            now students are able to print double-sidedly at ECE building.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h5>I am always learning and I learn FAST.</h5>
          </li>
          <p><b>Example 1:</b> &nbsp;I have finished a 46-hour long web development course on Udemy just over a weekend.
            Right on the next Monday, I started applying the new skills to build <a href="mixtaped.html"
              target="_blank">Mixtaped</a> website.</p>
          <p><b>Example 2:</b> &nbsp;This explains why I've had hands-on experience with skills like Solidity
            (Blockchain), ROS, Raspberry Pi, Sass, Java for Android, Swift for iOS, many different web development
            technologies, Data Science etc that I did not learn from my formal university classes.</p>

          <li>
            <h5>I can make amazing progress</h5>
          </li>
          <p><b>Example 1:</b> &nbsp;I have single-handedly coded <a href="mixtaped.html" target="_blank">Mixtaped</a>
            website from scratch within just about two months which includes features like multi-level commenting on a
            song page, upload and playing songs/videos, changing personal page's cover photo and many more all while
            taking a summer course at U of I.</p>
          <p><b>Example 2:</b> &nbsp;I started Reltup, a social network for startups, in 2016. I consistently woke
            up at 5am every morning to work on my startup. Within three months time, I built the startup website with
            many features and had brought it into round 64 of the Student Startup Madness competition and I was also
            featured on U of I campus newspaper.</p>

          <li>
            <h5>I think independently.</h5>
          </li>
          <p>
            <b>Example 1:</b> &nbsp;I disagree with our education system in many ways. I think schooling is an impedance
            to learning. Is schooling the best way to learn? How many percentage of all the things we have learned in
            school do we actually use after graduation?
          </p>
          <!--
            <p>
              <b>Example 2:</b> &nbsp;I disagree with the concept of marriage and family. Hence, I have a vision to create a new form of society where people would live very differently than how they live today. And this will give rise to a new era of happy, authentic, and energetic world of lively people.</p>
            </p>
