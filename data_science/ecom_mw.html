        <!-- <p class="pub-date-text">Publication date: Dec. 6, 2019</p> -->
        <br>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            An ecommerce company based in New York City sells clothing online and they also have in-store style and
            clothing advice seesions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Technologies</h3>
        <p>Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>Based on a customer dataset given by the company, find out whether the company should focus on developing
            mobile app or web app to best serve their customers that will
            in turn generate the most profit for the company.<br><br><br></p>

        <p>Let's begin!</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Step 1: Explore the given dataset</h3>
        <p>Let's read in the dataset<br>
            <div class="code-segment">
                <code>
                import pandas as pd<br>
                customers = pd.read_csv("ecomm_customers")
            </code><br>
            </div>
            Check what columns are given
            <div class="code-segment">
                <code>
                list(customers.columns)
            </code><br>
            </div>
            <div class="output-segment">
                >>> ['Email', 'Address', 'Avatar', 'Avg. Session Length', 'Time on App', 'Time on Website', 'Length of
                Membership', 'Yearly Amount Spent']<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Since our goal is to maximize the company's profit, "Yearly Amount Spent" seems to be a crucial feature we
            will be focusing on. <br>"Time on App" and "Time on Website" also seem to be important to answer the
            original
            question "Mobile or Web?". <br><br>
            Now, let's visualize the correlation between each of the features using Seaborn.
            <div class="code-segment">
                <code>
                import seaborn as sns<br>
                sns.heatmap(customers.corr(), annot=True)
            </code><br>
            </div>
            <img alt="heatmap" src="./../img/ecom_mw/heatmap.png" style="width: 550px; height: auto;"><br>
            A correlation value of 1 means that the two features correlate to each other completely.
            For example, it makes sense that "Time on App" is 100% correlated with "Time on App" itself.
            We can safely ignore the 1s in this plot.<br><br>

            We can see there is a very high correlation value of 0.81 between "Yearly Amount Spent" and "Length of
            Membership". Hence, we know that the longer the membership, the more amount that customer will
            spend.<br><br>

            Since this insight doesn't give a direct answer to our original question of "Mobile or Web?", let's continue
            exploring the data given.<br><br>

            Visualize "Time on App" vs "Yearly Amount Spent"<br>
            <div class="code-segment">
                <code>
                    sns.jointplot(x="Time on App", y="Yearly Amount Spent", data=customers)
                </code><br>
            </div>
            <img alt="app vs spent" src="./../img/ecom_mw/joint_app.png" style="width: 450px; height: auto;"><br><br>
            "Time on Website" vs "Yearly Amount Spent"<br>
            <div class="code-segment">
                <code>
                    sns.jointplot(x="Time on Website", y="Yearly Amount Spent", data=customers)
                </code><br>
            </div>
            <img alt="web vs spent" src="./../img/ecom_mw/joint_web.png" style="width: 450px; height: auto;"><br>
        </p>
        From the above two plots, we can see "Time on App" has a more linear relationship to "Yearly Amount Spent" (more
        time on app, more
        profit to the company).<br><br>
        <b>At this point, we can already conclude that the mobile app is more profitable than the website.</b><br><br>
        However, let us still build a Linear Regression model to see if we missed out any crucial components
        <div class="code-segment">
            <code>
                    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split<br><br>
                    y = customers['Yearly Amount Spent']<br>
                    X = customers[['Avg. Session Length', 'Time on App', 'Time on Website', 'Length of Membership']]<br>
                    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)<br>
                </code><br>
        </div>
        build the model:
        <div class="code-segment">
            <code>
                    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression<br><br>
                    lm = LinearRegression()<br>
                    lm.fit(X_train, y_train)<br>           
                    </code><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Using the model, let's see how all the features relate to company's profit - "Yearly Amount Spent":
        <div class="code-segment">
            <code>
                    coeffs = pd.DataFrame(lm.coef_, X.columns)<br>
                    coeffs.columns = ['Coefficient']<br>
                    coeffs         
                        </code><br>
        </div>
        <img alt="heatmap" src="./../img/ecom_mw/coeffs.png" style="width: 250px; height: auto;"><br><br>
        Interpretation: <br>
        1. Every 1 unit (minute) increase in time spent on website would increase ~$0.499 in company's
        profit.<br>
        2. Every 1 unit (minute) increase in time spent on mobile app would increase ~$38.325 in company's
        profit.<br>

        <br><br>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        The analysis suggests that mobile app is 76 times more profitable than the website.<br>
        However, it is unclear from the data whether the website is an important piece that supports the mobile
        experience.<br>
        <b>Hence, I suggest that the company invest just enough to make the website functional and decent. And focus the
            rest of the available effort into optimizing the mobile experience and bringing customers onboard to using
            the
            mobile
            app.<b>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <p class="text-center"><b>The End.<br> I hope you enjoyed the reading. <3</b> </p> <br>
